## Day-4

1.VPC Peering 

2.VPC Endpoints

3.EBS and its Types

4.Perform a vpc peering and get a snap shot of ebs and replicate in different region .


1.Whai is Vpc?
VPC is a virtual private network which has isolated environment with the aws cloud.

2.what is subnet?
A subnet is  a range of IP addresses in your VPC.

3.What is CIDR range?
CIDR is a Class-Inter-Domain-Routing .It allocates the ip address range.

4.What is Nat Gateway?
Nat Network address translation used to provide the internet to the private network.
where it works as only one way traffic from the private subnet.

5.What is Nacl?
Network access control list it is similar to sg (security groups ) but in nacl you can deny the ip iddress.

6.What is Route Table?
Route table are used to route the traffic to the subnets.

7.What is IGW?
Internet gateway is used to provide the internet access to the vpc.



# Vpc Endpoint:

A VPC Endpoint in AWS allows you to privately connect your VPC.VPC endpoint services doesnt requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection.

They are two types of Vpc Endpoints:

1.Interface Endpoints:
 It operates the elastic network interface with in your vpc.

2.Gateway Endpoints: 
It operates the mainly route table, used for supported services such as S3 and DynamoDB.

# EBS (Elastic Block Storage)

EBS is a block level storage it is used for store the persistent data.Where we attach the extra storage space to the ec2.

Three types of EBS:
1.SSD Volumes
2.HDD Volumes
3.Previous generation volumes

* SSD Volumes:
    SSD volumes are used for high performance and low latency storage.
    Types are:
    1.General Perpose
    2.GP2 
    3.GP3
* gp2 and gp3 are nothing but the versions.
    4.IO1   
    5.IO2
    6.IO3

io1,io2 & io3 are also versions but iops is input output per second it is used for faster access it is used mainly when u have large applications.Common gp2 and gp3 is preferred.
