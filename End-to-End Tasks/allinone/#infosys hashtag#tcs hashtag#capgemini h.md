Yesterday, I called up a friend to catch up and asked him what he was up to. 
He surprised me by saying he’s working as an Amazon delivery agent. Curious, 
I asked him how much he makes, and I was honestly shocked by his response. 
He told me he earns around ₹48,000 per month, 
plus extra for deliveries, and even gets an electric vehicle provided by the company.

I couldn’t believe it. I’ve been working as a software engineer for the past two years, 
and I’m nowhere near that figure. It made me reflect on how, in the software industry,
 we often work long hours, putting in endless effort, but don't always feel like 
 we’re compensated fairly—especially given the degrees and skills we’ve worked hard to attain.

It’s eye-opening to see how someone without a formal degree can sometimes earn more than a qualified software engineer.
 This isn’t to undermine the hard work of delivery agents—far from it—but it makes me question the value and recognition the software 
 industry places on its employees.

My takeaway? Indian companies, especially big MNCs, need to reevaluate their base salaries 
and make jobs in software truly worth it. It's disheartening when companies like hashtag#Infosys, 
hashtag#Cognizant, hashtag#Accenture, and hashtag#KPIT hashtag#capgemini hashtag#tcs hashtag#deloitte expect 
10-hour workdays, six days a week, for salaries that don’t reflect the value we bring.

It’s time for change. Let’s raise our voices and demand the respect and compensation we deserve.





















Process Monitor:

Using Process Monitor (ProcMon) during dynamic analysis, you can observe file system activity.
Filter the results to show only File Write operations.
Identify the suspicious file based on its path (e.g., a file written to C:\Temp, C:\Windows\System32, or a hidden directory) or its file name (e.g., random characters like Xx123.tmp, malicious.dll).
Suspicious File Name:

Example: A file named malware.dll being written to the C:\Windows\System32 directory could be considered suspicious as malware often tries to hide in system directories.
Action for a Malware Analyst:

A malware analyst would take note of the file name and location.
The next steps would involve further investigation of the file by running it through anti-malware tools, reverse engineering, or sandbox testing to analyze its behavior.
