1. Download the Update
Visit the Microsoft Update Catalog for CU28 or the official SQL Server 2019 Cumulative Updates page to find and download the update.
Search for "Cumulative Update 28 for SQL Server 2019".
Choose the version that matches your system architecture (e.g., x64) and download the .exe installer.

2. Backup the SQL Server Database
Before applying any updates, it's essential to back up your databases:
Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
Right-click on the database you want to back up, choose Tasks > Back Up.
Save the backup files in a safe location.

3. Test in Non-Production Environment\
Before deploying CU28 to production, it’s a good idea to install and test the update in a non-production environment to ensure compatibility and stability.

4. Stop SQL Server Services
It’s recommended to stop SQL Server services before applying the update:
Open Services (Windows key + R, then type services.msc).
Find the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service and right-click it, then select Stop.
Also, stop related services like SQL Server Agent if it's running.

5. Run the CU28 Installer
Locate the downloaded .exe file and double-click to run the installer.
Follow the on-screen instructions, which will guide you through the installation process.
The installer will detect the SQL Server instance(s) and apply the update.

6. Restart SQL Server Services
After the installation is complete:
Go back to Services (services.msc).
Restart the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service.
If applicable, restart the SQL Server Agent service and any other SQL-related services.

7. Verify the Installation
Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
Run the following query to verify the SQL Server version and ensure CU28 is installed:
sql
Copy code
SELECT @@VERSION;
The result should show the build number for CU28, which is 15.0.4312.2.

8. Monitor Logs and System
Check the SQL Server logs and Event Viewer for any issues or errors during the update.
Test your databases and applications to ensure everything is running smoothly.

9. Apply CU28 to Production (If tested in Non-Production)
Once you're confident with the test, repeat the same process on your production environment.

By following these steps, you'll be able to safely install CU28 on SQL Server 2019 running on Windows Server.
