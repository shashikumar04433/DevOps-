## Elastic Block Storage (EBS):
```
EBS stands for Elastic Block Store. It's a service that offers
block storage volumes for use with EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances.
EBS volumes are highly available and reliable storage volumes that can be
attached to any running EC2 instance in the same AvailabilityZone.
They are like your hard drives on the cloud, but with the added benefit of scalability, persistence, and durability.
```
**Amazon EBS volumes**
```
These are storage volumes that you attach to Amazon EC2 instances.
After you attach a volume to an instance, you can use it in the same way
you would use a local hard drive attached to a computer, for example to store files or to install applications.
```
**Amazon EBS snapshots**
```
These are point-in-time backups of Amazon EBS volumes that persist independently from the volume itself.
You can create snapshots to back up the data on your Amazon EBS volumes.
You can then restore new volumes from those snapshots at any time.
