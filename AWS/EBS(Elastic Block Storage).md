## Elastic Block Storage (EBS):
```
EBS stands for Elastic Block Store. It's a service that offers
block storage volumes for use with EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances.
EBS volumes are highly available and reliable storage volumes that can be
attached to any running EC2 instance in the same AvailabilityZone.
They are like your hard drives on the cloud, but with the added benefit of scalability, persistence, and durability.
